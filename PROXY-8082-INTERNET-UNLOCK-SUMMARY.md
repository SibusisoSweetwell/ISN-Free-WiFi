# Proxy 8082 Internet Unlock System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented your requested proxy system on port 8082 that controls internet access based on video watching. The system now enforces strict video-based internet unlocking.

## Key Features Implemented

### üö´ **STRICT BLOCKING BEFORE VIDEOS**
- **All internet access BLOCKED** until users watch videos
- **Social media apps BLOCKED** (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- **Only portal and video ads allowed** (walled garden approach)
- Users cannot access ANY websites or social media without watching videos first

### üé¨ **VIDEO-BASED UNLOCKING SYSTEM**
- Users must **watch videos** in the portal
- After video completion, they receive a **notification**
- **Internet access unlocks** only after notification is received
- **Social media unlocks** automatically after first video
- System tracks video completion with device-specific notifications

### üìä **PROGRESSIVE ACCESS LEVELS**
```
1 video    = 20MB   + Social media access
5 videos   = 100MB  + Full internet access  
10 videos  = 250MB  + Extended access
15 videos  = 500MB  + Premium access
```

### üîÑ **DATA LIMIT ENFORCEMENT**
- When users reach their data limit, they are **redirected back to portal**
- Must watch more videos to gain additional access
- Clear notifications explain why access was blocked
- Seamless redirect flow back to video portal

## Technical Implementation

### **Proxy Server (Port 8082)**
- Enhanced HTTPS proxy with video notification checking
- Enhanced HTTP proxy with the same restrictions
- Device-specific access tracking
- Real-time data usage monitoring

### **Access Control Logic**
```javascript
// Check if user received video completion notification
const deviceSession = deviceSessions.get(deviceId);
if (deviceSession && deviceSession.videoNotificationReceived) {
    // Grant internet access based on videos watched
    unlockInternetAccess(user);
    unlockSocialMedia(user);
}
```

### **Video Completion System**
- Sets `videoNotificationReceived` flag when video completes
- Creates data bundles at milestone achievements
- Provides immediate device access tokens
- Shows success notification to user

## User Flow

### **1. Initial Connection**
- User connects to WiFi
- Tries to access internet ‚Üí **BLOCKED**
- Redirected to portal with clear instructions

### **2. Portal Entry**
- Only portal and video ads load (walled garden)
- User sees video watching interface
- Clear explanation of how to unlock internet

### **3. Video Watching**
- User watches video advertisements
- System tracks completion per device
- Video domains allowed even when blocked

### **4. Notification & Unlock**
- Upon video completion: **notification appears**
- "üéâ Internet Access Unlocked!" message
- Internet and social media instantly accessible

### **5. Data Usage Monitoring**
- Real-time tracking of data consumption
- When limit reached ‚Üí redirect to portal
- Clear explanation and "watch more videos" option

## Enhanced Features

### **Device Isolation**
- Each device must watch videos individually
- MAC address tracking for strict device control
- Prevents sharing access between devices

### **Smart Redirections**
```html
<h1>Internet Access Blocked - Watch Videos First</h1>
<p>Reason: Videos must be watched first</p>
<ol>
  <li>üì± Enter the WiFi portal</li>
  <li>üé¨ Watch video advertisements</li>
  <li>üì¢ Wait for completion notification</li>
  <li>üåê Internet access unlocked!</li>
</ol>
```

### **Social Media Blocking**
- WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram blocked until videos watched
- Auto-unlock after first video completion notification
- Separate tracking for social media access

### **Video Ad Protection**
- Video domains always allowed (even when blocked)
- Ensures ads can load and play properly
- Ad traffic doesn't count against data quota

## Configuration

### **Proxy Settings for Users**
- **Manual Proxy**: `10.5.48.94:8082`
- **Auto Proxy (PAC)**: `http://10.5.48.94:3150/proxy.pac`

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
PROXY_PORT=8082               # Fixed proxy port
ENABLE_PROXY=true            # Enable proxy server
STRICT_WALLED=true           # Strict walled garden mode
```

## Benefits Achieved

‚úÖ **Seamless Flow**: Portal ‚Üí Videos ‚Üí Notification ‚Üí Internet Access  
‚úÖ **Data Limit Enforcement**: Automatic portal redirect when exhausted  
‚úÖ **Device-Specific Control**: Each device earns its own access  

## Security Features

üîí **MAC Address Tracking**: Prevents device access sharing  
üîí **Session Tokens**: Secure device authentication  
üîí **Real-time Monitoring**: Live data usage tracking  
üîí **Notification-Based Unlock**: Must receive completion notification
