// MAC-BASED DEVICE ISOLATION - COMPREHENSIVE FIX SUMMARY
// ======================================================

/*
PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
The original issue was that internet access wasn't being granted even after users got 
their 100MB bundle notification. The root cause was insufficient device isolation - 
the system wasn't properly tracking which specific device earned the access.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
===================
Implemented robust MAC address-based device isolation as suggested by the user's requirements.
*/

// 1. ENHANCED DEVICE FINGERPRINTING (server.js ~line 61)
// =====================================================
/*
OLD SYSTEM:
- Used User-Agent + headers for device identification
- Weak fingerprinting, easily spoofed
- No MAC address enforcement

NEW SYSTEM:
- Primary identification by MAC address (ARP table lookup)
- MAC-based device ID generation for strict isolation
- Fallback fingerprinting only when MAC unavailable
- macVerified flag to distinguish between strong/weak identification
*/

// Example of new device identification:
/*
Device with MAC: deviceId = SHA256("MAC:" + macAddress)
Device without MAC: deviceId = SHA256(userAgent + headers + ip + router)
*/

// 2. STRICT DEVICE ACCESS VERIFICATION (server.js ~line 2265)
// ===========================================================
/*
OLD SYSTEM:
- Checked general user bundles without device verification
- Any device could use bundles earned by other devices
- No per-device access control

NEW SYSTEM:
- MAC-verified devices: Check device-specific access tokens
- Non-MAC devices: Verify the device actually earned the bundles
- Fallback to video count with session usage tracking
- Each device must prove it earned its own access
*/

// 3. MAC-BOUND ACCESS TOKENS (device-isolation-enhancement.js)
// ============================================================
/*
NEW FEATURES ADDED:
- createDeviceAccessToken(): Creates MAC-bound access tokens
- getDeviceAccessToken(): Retrieves tokens by device ID or MAC
- Token expiry and automatic cleanup
- MAC-to-device mapping for cross-reference
*/

// 4. ENHANCED VIDEO COMPLETION HANDLER (server.js ~line 3550)
// ===========================================================
/*
NEW BEHAVIOR:
- Gets full device fingerprint including MAC address
- Creates MAC-bound access token when bundle is earned
- Registers device with multiple access keys (deviceId, MAC, IP, identifier)
- Immediate cache clearing for instant access
*/

// 5. PER-DEVICE SESSION ISOLATION
// ===============================
/*
IMPLEMENTATION:
- activeClients map uses device-specific keys
- MAC addresses serve as primary device identifiers
- Sessions cannot be shared between devices
- Each device maintains separate usage tracking
*/

// TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
// =================================

/*
MAC ADDRESS RESOLUTION:
1. Primary: deviceIsolation.getMACAddressEnhanced() using ARP table
2. Fallback: Direct ARP command execution
3. Timeout protection (2-3 seconds max)
4. Error handling for network issues

DEVICE ID GENERATION:
- MAC available: SHA256("MAC:" + macAddress)
- No MAC: SHA256(userAgent + headers + ip + router) + warning

ACCESS TOKEN STRUCTURE:
{
  accessToken: "hex-token",
  macAddress: "device-mac",
  identifier: "user-id", 
  earnedAt: timestamp,
  expiresAt: timestamp,
  videosWatched: count,
  bundlesMB: amount,
  deviceId: "device-id"
}

PROXY ACCESS LOGIC:
1. Get device fingerprint with MAC
2. If MAC verified: Check device-specific token
3. If no MAC: Verify device earned bundles  
4. Grant access only if device-specific verification passes
5. Track usage per device
*/

// EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE:
// ========================
/*
SCENARIO 1: Single device user
1. User watches 5 videos on Device A
2. Device A gets MAC-bound 100MB access token
3. Device A can browse internet immediately
4. Access tracked per Device A's MAC address

SCENARIO 2: Multiple device user  
1. User watches 5 videos on Device A â†’ Device A gets 100MB access
2. User tries to browse on Device B â†’ BLOCKED (no device-specific access)
3. User must watch 5 videos on Device B â†’ Device B gets its own 100MB access
4. Both devices now have independent access

SCENARIO 3: Shared WiFi environment
1. Person A watches videos on Phone A â†’ Phone A gets access
2. Person B on same WiFi tries to browse on Phone B â†’ BLOCKED
3. Person B must watch their own videos to earn access
4. No cross-device contamination
*/

// SECURITY BENEFITS:
// ==================
/*
âœ… MAC Address Binding: Access tied to physical device
âœ… Device Session Isolation: No shared sessions
âœ… Token Expiry: Access expires, requires re-earning
âœ… ARP Table Verification: Real MAC address tracking
âœ… Per-Device Usage Tracking: Independent data allowances
âœ… Router-Level Blocking: Optional strict mode for one device per router
*/

// CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
// ======================
/*
Environment Variables:
- MAC_BINDING_ENABLED=true/false (default: true)
- STRICT_DEVICE_ISOLATION=true/false (default: false)
- ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS=24 (default: 24 hours)

Strict Mode Effects:
- Only one device per router can have access at a time
- Other devices blocked when one is active
- Maintains dignified user experience
- Prevents household sharing abuse
